  BaskIt is an AI-powered grocery shopping assistant built with Python and Streamlit.
  It helps users collect grocery items via free text, voice, or images, and manage
  their shopping list in a modular, multilingual environment (Hebrew UI). The app
  supports shared lists, user preferences, undo history, and optional online ordering
  from Hebrew supermarket sites.

tech_stack:
  - Python 3.x
  - Streamlit (RTL Hebrew UI)
  - SQLite + SQLAlchemy
  - loguru for structured logging
  - python-dotenv for config
  - Google Auth (future)
  - Mocked API calls (OpenAI, Whisper, OCR), toggled via `.env`

guidelines:
  - Use modular architecture: `ai/`, `services/`, `db/`, `utils/`, `pages/`, etc.
  - Always start features using mocked APIs, replaceable with real ones via config
  - All product and list data is in Hebrew
  - Use grounded, up-to-date official documentation for all libraries
  - Implement structured logging with `loguru`, to both file and console
  - Each development step should be approved before moving to the next one
  - All modules should include basic unit tests from the start using `pytest`
  - Use the `tests/` folder with a structure that mirrors the main codebase (e.g., `test_services/`, `test_ai/`, etc.)
  - Test mocked behavior first and ensure it's consistent with intended production behavior
  - Tests are part of every development step and must pass before adding features

phases:
  - Phase 1: Build a working skeleton with mock pipelines and Streamlit UI
  - Phase 2: Add real list management and AI parsing
  - Phase 3: Connect image/voice input
  - Phase 4: Add sharing, preferences, undo, and supermarket integration

testing:
  framework: pytest
  structure: mirrored folder layout under `tests/`
  notes:
    - All mocked APIs must be testable in isolation
    - Real API calls will be covered later with integration tests
    - CI via GitHub Actions is encouraged once tests grow
